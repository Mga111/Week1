# Week1

Consider this description of a software system that you are developing to
keep track of employees and students at a university.

A university wants an application to manage ID cards for people who work
for or who attend the university. When a person is hired, they are assigned
a unique identifier that we'll call a utor ID. A person may have an arbitrary
number of names â€” first and last, maybe a middle name, maybe just first, maybe
seven names. People should be able to change any of their names.

Some people at the university are students. Students also have another unique
identifier called a student ID.

When a person's information is displayed, the university wants the full name
plus any identifiers, all on one line.
